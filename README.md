## üß© Features

-   **Search:**

    -   Reacts after 3+ characters.
    -   Searches across all fields (including nested fields like CEO name, revenue, etc.).
    -   Supports partial matches, exact matches, and numeric comparisons (e.g., `founded_year > 2000`).
    -   Debounced input for performance.

-   **Sorting:**

    -   Sort by name, revenue, founded year, or company type.
    -   Custom comparator functions for different data types.

-   **Filtering:**

    -   Filter by industry and company type using dropdowns.
    -   Multiple filters can be applied at once.

-   **Responsive UI:**

    -   Clean, responsive layout.
    -   ‚ÄúNo results found‚Äù message when no companies match.

-   **Bonus Extensions:**
    -   **Advanced search:** Supports logical operators in queries (e.g., `industry:Finance AND revenue>1000000`).
    -   **Debounced search input:** Reduces unnecessary filtering while typing.
    -   **Extended data model:** Includes board members, offices, and stock info for each company.
    -   **Testable logic:** Core search, filter, and sort logic is separated into utility functions for easy maintaining.

## üìù Notes on Complex Logic & Extensions

-   **Custom Search Algorithm:**  
    The search logic parses the query to support partial matches, exact matches, and numeric comparisons. It also supports logical operators like `AND` for advanced queries.

-   **Debounced Search:**  
    The search input uses a debounce hook to delay filtering until the user stops typing, improving performance and UX.

-   **Extensible Data Model:**  
    The company data includes related models such as `board_members`, `offices`, and `stock_info`, making the app easily extensible for future requirements.

-   **Testability:**  
    Core logic for searching, sorting, and filtering is extracted into utility files, making it easy to write and run unit tests.
